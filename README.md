# DMOJ-Questions

## Description
This repository contains solutions to questions selected from DMOJ, an online contest platform and archive of programming questions. At first, solving these questions helped me hone my programming skills after having learned the basics of C++ in class. After that, I continued solving increasingly complicated problems because it was an enjoyable way to pass the time while improving my problem solving skills. These programs, mostly developped during the summers of 2019, 2020, and 2021, helped maintain my programming skills over the break. Through these questions, I have also learned new problem solving techniques such as recursion, greedy algrothms, and graph theory.

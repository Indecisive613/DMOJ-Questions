# DMOJ-Questions

## Description
This repository contains my solutions to various questions selected from DMOJ, an online contest platform and archive of programming questions. At first, solving these problems helped me hone my programming skills after having learned the basics of C++ in class. After that, I continued solving increasingly complicated problems because it was an enjoyable way to pass the time. These programs, mostly developped during the summers of 2019, 2020, and 2021, helped maintain my programming proficiency and greatly improved my problem solving skills. Through these questions, I have learned the importance of formulating a proper approach before jumping right into the code, and my incorrect submissions to DMOJ have helped me gain experience debugging. Finally, these questions have given me the opporunity to learn and apply new problem solving techniques such as recursion, greedy algrothms, and graph theory.
